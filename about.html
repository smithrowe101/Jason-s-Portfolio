        <h2 class="hline1">__________________________________________________________________________________________________________</h2>
        <p>My name is Ajayi Boluwatife Mojolaoluwa Jason, I am a Frontend developer although i aim to be a full stack developer. I build websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. I am currently in my fourth year studying Computer Engineering in Redeemers University(RUN), Ede. My journey so far in RUN has been a delight, I've been able to build a strong foundation in the coding industry since my admission into the University. Not only am i familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, i'm also good with python(Python was actually the first programming language i started learning). Amongst other programming language i make use of are C, C++, and JAVA.   
        </p> 
        <p>I intend to build games, apps, websites, AI, and hope to be a great asset to several companies globally</p>

        <h2 class="hline2">__________________________________________________________________________________________________________</h2>
        <p>I grew up in the south western part of Nigeria, Lagos state. Although, I was born in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. My family hails from the Yoruba ethnic group, one of the largest ethnic groups in Nigeria. Yoruba culture deeply influences my daily life. I speaks Yoruba fluently, alongside English. I am also a Christian, a Foursquairian to be precise.            
        I have always had a keen interest in technology and its potential to drive societal change. My passion for computer Engineering is driven by a desire to develop innovative solutions for local challenges. My academic interests include artificial intelligence, software development, and cybersecurity. I am particularly interested in how technology can be leveraged to improve education and healthcare systems in Nigeria and anywhere i find myself.</p>
